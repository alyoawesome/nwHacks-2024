# Inspiration
As students who are often busy studying and forget to take care of ourselves, we decided to create AquaDrop to motivate us to stay hydrated by drinking at least 8 cups of water a day.

# What it does
AquaDrop is a habit tracker that helps monitor your water intake everyday. With a set goal of 8 cups of water a day, you can see how much water you've drank over the last week.

# How we built it
React for the front end, Node and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
